# Graphic Pipeline and GPGPU

Graphic Pipeline is a conceptual model that describes what steps a graphics system needs to perform to render a 3D scene to a 2D screen[1]. With few decades evolving, Graphic Card gradually moved to flexibility, and abstrcted multiple statge compute units to a general purpose compute unit, GPGPU.
