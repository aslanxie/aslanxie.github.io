# Scale Invariant Feature Transform
Here is the orignal paper: [Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf), which descirbe SIFT. The paper introduce the steps and exmperiments to determine parameters. 

[Anatomy of the SIFT Method](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2014/82/) is another paper and try to explain the detail of every step (with C source code) in SIFT algorithm.
