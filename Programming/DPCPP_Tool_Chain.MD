# DPCPP Tool Chain
# Data Parallel C++ (DPC++)

From Intel [definition](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/data-parallel-c-plus-plus.html): DPC++ = ISO C++ and Khronos SYCL* and community extensions. DPC++ is an open alternative to single-architecture proprietary languages. It allows developers to reuse code across hardware targets (CPUs and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs) and also perform custom tuning for a specific accelerator. These code walkthroughs introduce you to basic principles and practices of DPC++ programming. 

 DPCPP is a Intel **compiler** for DPC++, provides you with both host and device side compilation.
