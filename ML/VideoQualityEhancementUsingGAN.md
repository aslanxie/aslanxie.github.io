## Video Quality Ehancement Using GAN

Before Chinese New Year, a server with 2 sockets CPUs(24x2 cores), a 1080Ti GPU, 1T AEP memory and 2 NVME disks have been set up finally. I think it's enough for most of simple deep learning model.

I'll try to apply GAN on video frame for video quality enhancement at this time, like pix2pix model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix).
