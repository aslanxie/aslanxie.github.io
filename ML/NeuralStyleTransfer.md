## Neural Stylee Transfer

It inpsired new way to compute loss for deep learning. There are 2 different way for style transfer:
* apply gradient on image dierectly, such as [Neural Sytpe Transfer](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer), 
[Neural Style Transfer & Neural Doodles](https://github.com/titu1994/Neural-Style-Transfer)
* train a network to generate a new image with the loss, for example [fast-neural-style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style), 
[Fast Style Transfer in TensorFlow 2](https://github.com/cryu854/FastStyle)
